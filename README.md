A simple app to let you display guild and character information from WoW via the battlenet API.

This is still a very early project and has almost no functionality at the moment, but please stay tuned
as more updates will follow!

The Goal of this app is to let you enter a server and guild and it will pull in the information.  Once the
guild data has been loaded you will then be able to browse character data as well.
